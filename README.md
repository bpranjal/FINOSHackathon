# FDC3 Context Schema Generator

This tool helps developers easily define FDC3 context schemas in the correct JSON Schema format. The tool simplifies the process of generating context schemas by providing an intuitive UI for entering example JSON data, defining titles and descriptions for each field, selecting types, and generating the corresponding JSON Schema.

This project is built with **React**, **Flask**, and integrates with **Quicktype.io** to convert JSON examples into JSON Schemas.

## How to Use

1. **Enter JSON Example:** 
   - Paste the JSON data that you want to generate a schema for into the input area.

2. **Define Field Titles and Descriptions:** 
   - For each field in the JSON example, enter a **title** and **description**.

3. **Select Field Types:** 
   - Choose an appropriate **type** for each field from the dropdown. This includes options like strings, integers, enums, regex patterns, and references to other context types.

4. **Generate Schema:** 
   - Click the **"Generate Schema"** button to generate the JSON Schema output, which is formatted according to FDC3 standards.

5. **Export Schema:** 
   - Once the schema is generated, you can **copy** it or **export** it for use in your project.
